msed - Manage Self Encrypting Drives

This program and it's accompanying Pre-Boot Authorization image allow
you to enable the locking in SED's that comply with the TCG OPAL 2.00
standard on bios machines.   

You must be administrator/root to run the host managment program

In Linux libata.allow_tpm must be set to 1. Either via adding libata.allow_tpm=1 to the kernel flags at boot time 
or changing the contents of /sys/module/libata/parameters/allow_tpm to a from a "0" to a "1" on a running system.

Currently there is only a PBA for BIOS machines and sleep (S3) is not supported.

Source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/r0m30/msed (host management program) and
https://github.com/syslinux (BIOS PBA)

Linux and Windows executables are available at http://www.r0m30.com/msed/files
