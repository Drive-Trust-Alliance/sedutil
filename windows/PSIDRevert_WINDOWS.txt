1. sedutil-cli --scan    <- SCAN to find Opal Drive (you should see Yes next the the drive
                     your working with.
2. sedutil-cli --query \\.\PhysicalDrive? <--this will show the Opal status look at the locking
                                               feature and see if it is Locked = Y
                                               or LockingEnabled = Y that's a good
                                                sign that this should work
3.sedutil-cli --yesIreallywanttoERASEALLmydatausingthePSID <YOURPSID> \\.\PhysicalDrive?

4.  You should see INFO: revertTper completed successfully.
    If you get a message that says NOT_AUTHORIZED you entered the PSID wrong.

If it doesn't work please execute the command in step 3 with a -vvvvv (5 v's) as the first option and
redirect the output to a file and send it back to me.
example:
sedutil-cli -vvvvv --yesIreallywanttoERASEALLmydatausingthePSID <YOURPSID> \\.\PhysicalDrive? > revertlog.txt 2>&1

Hope this helps.
