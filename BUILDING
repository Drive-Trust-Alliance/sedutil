sedutil is built using autotools and make.
steps:
autoreconf -i
./configure --enable-silent-rules
make
------------------------
This will also build the PBA ignore it.

If you get an errot building that says Version.h is missing
you need to make all. This is an issue with how autotools handles
built sources and dependencies.
