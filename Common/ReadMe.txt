You must be administrator/root to run this program

In Linux libata.allow_tpm must be set to 1. Either via adding libata.allow_tpm=1 to the kernel flags at boot time 
or changing the contents of /sys/module/libata/parameters/allow_tpm to a from a "0" to a "1" on a running system.

Currently the only operation that a general user would want to use is the PSID revert function
see linux/PSIDRevert_LINUX.txt or win32/PSIDRevert_WINDOWS.txt
