## Versioning to be consistent with other build scripts
VERSIONINFO=`git describe --dirty`  || VERSIONINFO=tarball

## We chose GRUB, and specifically v2.04, for documented Secure Boot support.
## Meanwhile Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS and Buildroot target 2019.02.6 are both still tied to v2.02
## so we can't easily use OS-level packages or any binaries already built as part of Buildroot.

GRUBGIT=https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/grub.git
## For whatever reason, older grub versions are tagged in the repo with bare version number but
## as of 2.02 they're tagged both ways (?!) and as of 2.04 only as "grub-${numeric}".
GRUBVER=grub-2.04
