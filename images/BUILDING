Building the PBA images for sedutil
These instructions are based on a Xubuntu 16.x system, YMMV.

Prereqs:
You need a multiarch system so that you can build both 32 & 64 bit systems.
build essential

Get/Build the pieces:

Getting the syslinux bootloader.

./getresources

Build the PBA kernels and root filesystems
./buildpbaroot

Build the image files.
Rescue -> ./buildrescue
biosLinux -> ./buildbios 
uefi64 -> ./buildUEFI64 

Building the syslinux based system:
The scripts assume that the syslinux repo is at the same level in the filesystem as sedutil

cd ../../syslinux
make
cd ../sedutil/images
./legacypba Release
./legacypba Debug
